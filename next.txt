THOUGHTS

check with TAs to make sure I'm going in the right direction

Should I need to make a seperate .cpp for the Automaton parent class or should just the .h be fine
Do I need to include the .h when I compile? 
The Automaton class is only a parent class, correct? 

Is creating a machines vector in the Lexer constructor the right way to do it? 

Next to do:
Make an ID, string, comment, and end of file class
also comment block that didn't end or string that didn't close class
Make the constructor for the Lexer where it creates the machines vector 
Create the Lexer Run function
